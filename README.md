## Coding Practices

### Javascript

- **JSDOCS** **:**
I use JSDOCS when writing a function in Javascript. This is so others can see what the function is supposed top do and what params etc to put in each area of the function for it tow work.



- **NAMING** **:**
When naming folders, files or codie within files, I use fully and suitable names. 
  For instance: ***auth*** = ❌ **|** ***authorization*** = ✅



- **TESTING** :
Unit-test-files with Jest I always put in the same folder as the JS-file that it tests. When testing the file ***login.js*** the testfile is named ***login.test.js***. This makes it quicker and easier for the testfile to find the file it is testing, and it is more understandable for the coder to work with both files. I believe that having a seperate folder fo all tests makes it harder for the coder to work with the tests and takes up more time since they need to navigate back and forth between folders instead of having both files in the same folder.
