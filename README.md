## Coding Practices

### Javascript

- **JSDOCS** **:**
I use JSDOCS when writing a function in Javascript. This is so others can see what the function is supposed top do and what params etc to put in each area of the function for it tow work.



- **NAMING** **:**
When naming folders, files or codie within files, I use fully and suitable names. 
  For instance: ***auth*** = ❌ **|** ***authorization*** = ✅
Also the names can either have camelCase ("loginFunction.js") or underscores ("login_function.js"). I can use both, but will only stick to one of these on a single project. But I am able to use both and I think that both have equally merit so if an employer or client wants it written in either I am adaptable. Naming the functions within a file I always use "camelCase", and if a single function has its own file I name that file the exact same as the function itself. For instance: Function in a file -> ***loginUser();*** | Filename -> ***loginUser.js***.



- **TESTING** :

**Unit tests :** Unit-test-files with Jest I always put in the same folder as the JS-file that it tests. When testing the file ***login.js*** the testfile is named ***login.test.js***. This makes it quicker and easier for the testfile to find the file it is testing, and it is more understandable for the coder to work with both files. I believe that having a seperate folder fo all tests makes it harder for the coder to work with the tests and takes up more time since they need to navigate back and forth between folders instead of having both files in the same folder.

**E2E tests :** Testing functionality is best done with real people testing the app in real time. But it can be a good idea to do E2E testing before it is sent to QA to test. This way we can ensure that everything is working as it should be before real testing begins.
